Exploring the Telephony Menu



The "Telephony" menu in Wireshark is used to analyze voice and video call data, offering tools like VoIP Calls to display call details, 
RTP Streams to analyze media flows, and options to play back audio streams for quality assessment. 
It contains functions for analyzing various communication protocols, including SIP, RTP, and others, to help identify issues in telephony-related traffic. 
Key functions in the Telephony menu

VoIP Calls:
Lists all VoIP calls detected in a capture.
Provides details like start time, duration, source, destination, and protocol.
Shows the call state (e.g., ringing, in-call) and the number of packets.
Can be used to analyze call signaling dialogs (e.g., INVITE, OK, BYE) by selecting a call and viewing its "Flow".


RTP Streams:
Allows for the analysis of the actual media streams, which are the voice packets.
Shows stream identifiers (SSRCs), payload types, packet counts, lost packets, and jitter.
Can play back the audio streams to listen to the call quality directly, often by selecting "Play Streams" after identifying the forward and reverse streams.
Provides analysis for delay, jitter, and loss.


Other telephony protocol analysis:
IAX2 Stream Analysis: Displays statistics and graphs for IAX2 calls.
ISUP Messages: Provides telephone signaling information for the ISUP protocol.
MTP3 Window: Shows statistics for the Message Transfer Part 3 (MTP3) protocol, which is part of Signaling System 7.
LTE: Displays statistics for captured LTE MAC traffic.
