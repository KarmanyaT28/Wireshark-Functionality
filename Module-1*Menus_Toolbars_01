Let us start with Open, which will allow you to load a pre-captured file

Next is "Open Recent", you can open recent captures from past and also clear away those old entries when the schedule gets busier

"Merge", this would merge that capture that you obtained with the one you currently have opened, it is really important that the time values are perfect,
because it will use the time value to synchronise the two files.

The next one is "import from hex dump", when we select and open a hex dump, ofcourse the offset is a hexadecimal and then down below,
you see the encapsulation type. We are using the ethernet encapsulation format

Close - Close the file

Save, Save as - Save the file

"File Set" - The File Set option in Wireshark is used to manage a group of related capture files, typically created when performing a long-term or high-volume capture. 
Instead of recording all the traffic into a single, massive file, Wireshark can be configured to save the packets across multiple smaller 
files based on conditions like size, duration, or a specific number of packets.

Exit - Close the Wireshark Interface
