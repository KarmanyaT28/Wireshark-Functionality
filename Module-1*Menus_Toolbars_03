Copy - In Wireshark, "copy" means to duplicate selected data and transfer it to the clipboard. Depending on where you are in the application, 
this can copy a display filter list, graph values, or packet bytes as text or raw hex data.


In Wireshark, the "Find Packet" function allows you to search for specific packets, while "Find Next" and "Find Previous" let you navigate between packets that match your search criteria. 
These tools are essential for analyzing large capture files to locate specific events or anomalies


In Wireshark, "mark/unmark" toggles the marked state of a selected packet, visually highlighting it with a black background for easy identification. 
"Mark all displayed packets" applies this marking to every packet currently visible in the Packet List pane, and "Unmark all displayed packets" removes the mark from all of them. 
These actions are useful for visually flagging packets for later review or for controlling output during export, but the marks are temporary and are lost when the capture is closed


In Wireshark, "ignoring" a packet temporarily hides it from the current view as if it doesn't exist, while "unignoring" makes it visible again. Ignored packets are displayed with a white background and gray text and are not saved in the capture file, 
so they are lost when Wireshark is closed. This function allows you to remove irrelevant packets from your analysis without permanently deleting them.


Setting a time reference in Wireshark marks a specific packet as a new starting point (\(0\) seconds) for the time-stamped packets that follow it. This feature helps analyze the time elapsed between packets after a specific event, 
making it easier to see relative time deltas without manual calculation. Time references are temporary and will be lost when the capture file is closed.


"time shift" refers to the ability to adjust the timestamps of all packets in a capture by a set offset. This changes the absolute time for every packet but preserves the relative time differences between them. 
It's useful for correcting capture errors, working with different time zones, or shifting a long capture to a more convenient time frame. 


In Wireshark, a packet comment is a custom note that you can add to an individual packet to document it for future reference or collaboration. 
These comments are saved directly within the capture file and help explain the packet's significance, a potential issue, or the protocol behavior being observed. 
They are distinct from general comments about the entire capture file and are added by right-clicking a packet and selecting "Packet Comment"


In Wireshark, a configuration profile is a saved set of custom settings that tailors the program's behavior for specific analysis tasks. 
This allows you to quickly switch between different setups for things like display filters, coloring rules, and disabled protocols without having to manually adjust them each time


In Wireshark, "preferences" refer to the user-configurable settings that customize the program's behavior and appearance for tasks like network analysis, troubleshooting, and training
