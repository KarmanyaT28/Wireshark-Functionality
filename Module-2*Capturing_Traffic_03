Capture Filters

Purpose: Filters applied before capturing packets. They limit what packets Wireshark records.
Syntax: BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter)

Common Capture Filters

Capture specific host:
host 192.168.1.10

Capture only traffic from IP:
src host 10.0.0.5

Capture only traffic to IP:
dst host 10.0.0.7

Capture only TCP traffic:
tcp

Capture only UDP traffic:
udp

Capture traffic on a port:
port 80
tcp port 443

Capture subnet:
net 192.168.1.0/24

Capture all traffic except SSH:
not port 22

Capture traffic between two IPs:
host 10.0.0.1 and host 10.0.0.2

Important Notes

You must set capture filters before starting the capture.

Capture filters are limited in syntax compared to display filters.

Capture filters cannot be modified after capture starts.

2. Display Filters

Purpose: Apply after capturing packets. Used for deeper analysis.
Syntax: Wireshark Display Filter Language (more powerful than capture filters).

Common Display Filters

Filter by IP:
ip.addr == 192.168.1.10

Filter by source/destination:
ip.src == 10.0.0.5
ip.dst == 10.0.0.7

Filter by protocol:
tcp
udp
http
dns

Show only TCP SYN packets:
tcp.flags.syn == 1

Show only TCP FIN packets:
tcp.flags.fin == 1

Show failed handshakes (SYN, no SYN-ACK):
tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0

Filter by port:
tcp.port == 443
udp.port == 53

Show only packets containing text:
frame contains "login"

Exclude packets:
not tcp
!(tcp.port == 22)

Key Notes

You can apply display filters anytime.

They don’t change the capture — only the view.

3. Find Packets

Purpose: Search inside packet data for specific content.

How to Use

Edit → Find Packet
Choose search type:

By Display Filter → find next packet that meets a filter.

By String → search inside:

Packet bytes

Packet details

Packet list column

By Hex Value → search for specific byte sequences.

Examples

Find packets containing the string “password”:
Find → String → Packet bytes → “password”

Find next DNS query:
Find → Display Filter → dns.flags.response == 0

4. Mark Packets

Purpose: Let you flag specific packets for later review.

How to Mark

Right-click → Mark Packet (or press Ctrl+M)

Marked packets turn black background with white text (default theme).

Why Use Marking

Keep track of handshake, teardown, suspicious packets.

Export only marked packets:
File → Export Specified Packets → Marked Packets

Untag Mark

Right-click → Unmark Packet

Remove all marks: Edit → Mark/Unmark All Displayed Packets

5. Fine-Tune Columns

Purpose: Customize the packet list to show the most useful information at a glance.

How to Edit Columns

Right-click any column → Column Preferences

Common Useful Columns
Column Name	What It Shows
Source	Source IP
Destination	Destination IP
Protocol	Protocol (TCP, UDP, DNS, etc.)
Length	Packet length
Info	Summary of packet
TCP Stream Index	For tracking conversations
TTL	Time To Live
Delta Time	Time difference between packets
Adding a Custom Column

Expand packet details panel

Right-click a field → Apply as Column
Example fields you often add:

tcp.flags

http.request.method

tcp.port

dns.qry.name

Why Fine-Tune Columns

Helps you analyze flows faster.

Makes it easier to detect anomalies.

Reduces the need to open packet details repeatedly.
