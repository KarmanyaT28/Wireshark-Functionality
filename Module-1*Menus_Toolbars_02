Export packets or objects and print

"Export Specified Packets" - Use "Range", for ex. 1-20 , which would give just the first 20 packets (Certain type of traffic)

"Export Packet Dissections" - In Wireshark, "Export Packet Dissections" means to save the detailed, human-readable analysis of the 
packets in a human-readable or machine-parseable format, such as plain text, CSV, or XML. 
This differs from a standard "Save As" which saves the raw packet data, as it focuses on extracting 
the dissected protocol information for reporting or further analysis. 

"Export Packet Bytes" - In Wireshark, "export packet bytes" refers to the process of saving the raw binary data of a selected packet, or a portion of it, 
to a file. This is distinct from exporting packet dissections (which are human-readable text representations) or exporting specific objects (like HTTP files).

"Export PDUs to File" - "Export PDUs to File" in Wireshark means to save a specific part of network traffic, such as the payload of a protocol at a certain network layer, into a new file. 
Instead of saving the entire packet, this feature lets you isolate the data from a chosen protocol, like layer 3 (IP) or layer 4 (TCP/UDP), and export it as its own file


"Export Objects" - is a feature that extracts and saves files or other objects that were transmitted over a network during a capture, such as images, files, or binaries sent via HTTP or SMB. 
It's crucial for network forensics, malware analysis, and reconstructing network activities by allowing users to save individual files or entire sets of captured data for further inspection

"print" refers to generating a static report of captured network packets, not just sending data to a physical printer. 
You can use the "Print" function from the File menu to format and output a specific range of packets to a file, which can then be reviewed or shared for analysis
